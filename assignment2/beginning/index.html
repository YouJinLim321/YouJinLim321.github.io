		<h1>Beginning of the world</h1>

		<h2>Concerning the creation of the universe, The Big Bang was not a single exposition in space. It was the initial appearance of space throughout the universe. According to The Big Bang Theory, the universe was born as a very hot, very dense, single point in space.Think of this as the canvas. Without a place for the universe to be created, there is no universe.Now imagine that visual existing within the screenwriter’s mind — which we can easily interpret as the imagination.When you decide that you want to begin a new screenplay, you open your mind to what you want to write. Because you are trying to break into the film and television industry, you are likely searching for a concept that will entice industry insiders to take a chance on you. To do that, you need to make a strong impression. And that strong impression has to be an idea or concept that is engaging and compelling.So the moment you open your mind to finding that enthralling idea or concept, your Big Bang has begun. You’ve created a canvas to work from.</h2>
