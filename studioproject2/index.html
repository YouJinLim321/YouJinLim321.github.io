		<h1>On beginnings</h1>
         
        <h2>In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it. In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finishedâ€”one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.</h2>
