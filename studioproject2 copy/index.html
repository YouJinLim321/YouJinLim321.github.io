		<p>In life, the number of beginnings<br>is exactly equal to the number of endings:<br>no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.<br>In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds<br>the number of endingsthat we cannot even conceive of it.<br>Not every poem is finished—</p>

		<pre>
one poem is abandoned,
		               another catches fire,
		                                     and is carried away by the wind,

which may be an ending,<br>but it is the ending of a poem without an end.
	</pre>

		<p>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker,<br>once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned.<br>This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé,<br>for where quotations begin is in a cloud.<br>Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly,<br>and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it:</p>

		<h1 class="second">The Opening Line of a Poem,<br>is like finding a fruit on the ground,<br>a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before,<br>and the poet’s task is to create<br>the tre from which<br> such a fruit would fall.</h2>

		<p>In the beginning was the Word.<br>Western civilization rests upon those words.<br>And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that<br>in the beginning was the Act. That nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act.</p>
