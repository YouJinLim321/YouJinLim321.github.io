		<p>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned.<br>This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud. Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said,</p>

		<p>is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall.</p>
