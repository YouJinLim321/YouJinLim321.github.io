  <p class="star1-1">Don’t question yourself just because someone
doesn’t get you, love you, or appreciate you.
Their opinions say nothing about your value.</p>
  <p class="star1-2">Mistakes are proof that you are trying. It’s better than doing nothing. 
You are on the right path.</p>
  <p class="star1-3">I’m always here for you.
I’ll always be on your side.</p>
  <p class="star1-4">Even now, as broken as you may feel,
you are still so strong.</p>
  <p class="star1-5">Your the only person that exist in the world!
Be proud of yourself.</p>
  <p class="star2-1">You have the prettiest smile</p>
  <p class="star2-2">Turn on your favorite music.
Can you share some with me?</p>
  <p class="star2-3">You’re enough.</p>
  <p class="star2-4">You can change how you feel.
First, clean things up that are messy now</p>
  <p class="star2-5">I’ll be your best friend forever.
I’m not going anywhere.</p>
  <p class="star3-1">Have a cup of tea and
relax.</p>
  <p class="star3-2">Open the window and
take a deep breath.
Watch how you breathe.</p>
  <p class="star3-3">You are going on the right path.
Don’t worry.</p>
  <p class="star3-4">Why don’t you turn on the music
and refresh your feelings?</p>
  <p class="star3-5">Take a warm breath and eat 
your favorite food.</p>
  <p class="star4-1">Call your best friend and 
have a small chat.</p>
  <p class="star4-2">You look awesome!</p>
  <p class="star4-3">Why don’t you wear your favorite clothes and hang out with your besties?</p>
  <p class="star4-4">I love you</p>
  <p class="star4-5">I’ll always be on your side.</p>
  <p class="star5-1">You look beautiful today.</p>
  <p class="star5-2">Take a selfie with your best mood!
I want to see your beautiful smile.</p>
  <p class="star5-3">Terrific!! I love your confidence.</p>
  <p class="star5-4">You’ll have a perfect day today.</p>
  <p class="star5-5">Why don’t you take a selfie of yourself
being this happy?</p>
